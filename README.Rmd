# slurmr

This package helps manage slurm files for TACC projects. Currently, it has functions to create slurm scripts and launch them on TACC with dependencies.  It also has a flexible syntax for specifying parameter run combinations.
Support for MPI isn't present yet, but will be added next time I need to use it.

## Installation

You can install `slurmr` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Christopher-Peterson/slurmr")
```
## Example

I'll add these eventually
